<span style="color: #383c3e">
The Invotiate Platform is a cloud based invoice negotiation platform that enables Suppliers ("Sellers") and Customers ("Buyers") to negotiate the terms of payment for an agreed sale/purchase transaction. Either Buyer or Seller (collectively referred to as the "Parties") can invite the other to initiate the negotiations on the terms of payment via the Platform. The Platform is designed to facilitate the Parties to offer their respective business counterparty discounts for early payments of premiums or for late payments within a range selected by the offering Party. Respective Parties can indicate acceptance of an offer by accessing the Platform, creating a unique transaction code to indicate settled negotiations. 
<br><br>
The Platform uses advanced machine learning technology and a proprietary algorithm which factors  the Parties inputs in the negotiation process before presenting the offer to the other Party.
